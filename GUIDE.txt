*** WELCOME TO THE GUIDE ***

Hello! that's just a test of my skills
using Powershell and the concept of Boilerplates. Be free to
explore all the folders of this repo.

*** JSON FILES ***
This folder will have .json files and
a sub-module with .xml files.

*** PROJECT BODY ***
That's the "core" of the project at all,
by the way,  there's more sub-modules that
follows a hierarchy.
